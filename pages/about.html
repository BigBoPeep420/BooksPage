<h3>Hello, my name is Lane.</h3>

<div>
    <p>
        I am in the process of completing The Odin Project, a course to teach full-stack web development.
        I've been interested in web dev since I first learned about injecting HTML to style MySpace pages.

        I'm not old! Your <strong><em>face</em></strong> is <strong>old</strong>!!

        <em>Annnyways</em>... I only slightly delved into it. I believe HTML3 was still standard at the time, with the
        web only just transitioning to HTML4, and CSS still in its early days. I was interested in PHP
        and backend but never learned more than enough to open and operate some SQL databases. Later in life
        I decided I wanted to learn a programming language and decided on C#. I learned quite a bit (not
        everything due to dramatic life events) and now Object-Oriented Programming is first nature. I've
        dabbled with LUA thanks to the game Stormworks. This is my first time learning or using JavaScript and
        I'm excited to start learning backend with it using Node.

        I got a little overzealous with this assignment. It was supposed to only be a single page that didn't save any data
        buuuttt... with my interest in Single Page Applications and a week with no Internet, I had to do something.
        I downloaded offline docs and asked Gemini quick questions when I was able to get signal with my phone and
        kept learning what I could. Now that I have connectivity again, I need to move on from this and start learning
        more. Some design cuts had to be made (for instance, I wanted to spend more time on the themes; specifically
        the colors). I hope you'll forgive these and at least appreciate the ambition that I sometimes hate.
