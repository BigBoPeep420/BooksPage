        Digital Dust Jackets is a great place to store a record of the books in your library. I created this site as
        an assignment from The Odin Project; you can read more in the About page. It uses IndexedDB to store the book's
        information in your browser. This was supposed to only be a single page that didn't actually save any data
        between page loads. Obviously I let my ambition get away from myself and so had to stop myself at some point;
        because of this the site isn't in an optimal state (animations, colors). I'd recommend changing the theme to 
        anything but the default.

        First, if you haven't noticed, there's a <em>thingamajig</em> to open the Navigation Pane on the left side
        of your screen. As you browse the site you'll see more <em>thingamajigs</em> that do various things on that page.
        You can change the site's Theme in Preferences (found in the Navigation Pane). To input books to store in your
        digital library, visit the My Books page. Other pages are just placeholders.

        In conclusion, stick to the assignment. Maybe add a few extra features. Do not evolve what's supposed to be
        a single page into a Single Page Application. That said, I loved every moment of this and learned a lot. I can't
        wait to start another SPA to apply what I've learned and make it cleaner. <strong>Thank you</strong> for reading and have a great day!
